Please list any challenge problems you completed on this lab below:

Lab 0:

Challenge: (1 bonus point) Add support for a "NULL" entry in the PATH
environment variable, i.e., two colons with nothing between them. 
For example: PATH=/bin:/sbin::/usr/bin. In this example, the third entry 
should be converted to the current working directory --- "./" would suffice.

The code we implemented looks in the path for the pattern "::" and replaces that
pattern with a '.' as an entry in the table. We remove the trailing slash as 
that was one of the expected behaviors for lab0.
The implementation of this challenge can be found on jobs.c in the helper
function char *replace_pattern

EX: PATH=/bin:/sbin::/usr/bin
Returns: 
===== Begin Path Table =====
Prefix  0: [/bin]
Prefix  1: [/sbin]
Prefix  2: [.]
Prefix  3: [/usr]
Prefix  4: [/bin]
===== End Path Table =====
